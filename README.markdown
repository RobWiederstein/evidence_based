## What is evidence-based policymaking?

According to the [Pew Foundation](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en), "[e]vidence-based policy making uses the best available research and data on program results to inform government budget, policy and management decisions.  It focuses on what works--those programs that rigorous evaluations have shown to achieve positive outcomes." Their 2015 publication, [Legislating Evidence-Based Policymaking:  A look at state laws that support data-driven decision-making](reports/2015-03-01_pew_legislating_evidence_based_policymaking.pdf), showcases many state initiatives and includes Kentucky.

## Legislative Approaches Categorized

Pew reports that between the years 2004 and 2014, over 100 state statutes passed that promoted the use of evidence-based programs.  They categorized the different legislative approaches across the country and  found that they fell into the following five groups:
        1. Require agencies to inventory and categorize funded programs by their evidence of effectiveness.
        2. Provide incentives for the use of evidence- and research-based programs.
        3. Restrict funding of programs shown to be ineffective.
        4. Require the use of evidence-or research-based programs.
        5. Dedicate funding to evidence-or research-based programs.

There were several key issues that legislators should consider when drafting statutes.  First, "it is important to provide clear definitions and standards for programs and the evidence needed to meet" the standard.  Second, potential areas for legislation should have a "robust evidence base" like criminal justice and mental health.  And third, even high quality, evidence-based programming can fail if implemented poorly.  Setting performance measures and monitoring compliance with program specifications is crucial for success.

## Developments US

The U.S. formed a Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEPM) by [statute](us/2016-03-30_us_evidence_based_comm_act.pdf) to make recommendations on how to improve government effectiveness through the use data and performance measures. The CEPM was established in March of 2017 and released its final report on September 7, 2017.  The 15 member Commission made 22 unanimous recommendations to the President and Congress.

## Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act

The CEPM's work was used in crafting the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act](us/2019-01-01_foundation_for_evidence_based_policymaking_summary.pdf) which became law in January, 2019.  The Act adopted approximately half of the CEPM's recommendations.

The Act requires that
- agencies annually submit a plan with a list relevant agency-specific policy questions and a list of data to be used as evidence in policymaking.  The Office of Management and Budget is to consolidate the plans into a unified evidence building plan;
- an Interagency Council on Evaluation Policy to assist in assessing program, policy and organization effectiveness and efficiency;
- Each agency must designate both a chief evaluation officer and an official with expertise in statistics;
- The OMB must establish an Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to advise on expanding access to government data;
- data must be published in a machine-readable format;
- each agency develop and maintain an inventory of all data assets; and
- a Chief Data Council be established with the Office of Management and Budget for establishing government-wide best practices for data.
