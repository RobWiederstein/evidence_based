## What is evidence-based policymaking?

According to the [Pew Foundation](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en), "[e]vidence-based policy making uses the best available research and data on program results to inform government budget, policy and management decisions.  It focuses on what works--those programs that rigorous evaluations have shown to achieve positive outcomes." Their 2015 publication, [Legislating Evidence-Based Policymaking:  A look at state laws that support data-driven decision-making](reports/2015-03-01_pew_legislating_evidence_based_policymaking.pdf), showcases many state initiatives and includes Kentucky.

## Legislative Approaches Categorized

Pew reports that between the years 2004 and 2014, over 100 state statutes passed that promoted the use of evidence-based programs.  They categorized the different legislative approaches across the country and  found that they fell into the following five groups:
1. Require agencies to inventory and categorize funded programs by their evidence of effectiveness.
2. Provide incentives for the use of evidence- and research-based programs.
3.  Restrict funding of programs shown to be ineffective.
4.  Require the use of evidence-or research-based programs.
5.  Dedicate funding to evidence-or research-based programs.

There were several key issues that legislators should consider when drafting statutes.  First, "it is important to provide clear definitions and standards for programs and the evidence needed to meet" the standard.  Second, potential areas for legislation should have a "robust evidence base" like criminal justice and mental health.  And third, even high quality, evidence-based programming can fail if implemented poorly.  Setting performance measures and monitoring compliance with program specifications is crucial for success.

## Developments US

The U.S. formed a Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEPM) by [statute](us/2016-03-30_us_evidence_based_comm_act.pdf) to make recommendations on how to improve government effectiveness through the use data and performance measures. The CEPM was established in March of 2017 and released its final report on September 7, 2017.  The 15 member Commission made 22 unanimous recommendations to the President and Congress.

## Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act

The CEPM's work was used in crafting the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act](us/2019-01-01_foundation_for_evidence_based_policymaking_summary.pdf) which became law in January, 2019.  The Act adopted approximately half of the CEPM's recommendations.

The Act requires that
- agencies annually submit a plan with a list relevant agency-specific policy questions and a list of data to be used as evidence in policymaking.  The Office of Management and Budget is to consolidate the plans into a unified evidence building plan;
- an Interagency Council on Evaluation Policy to assist in assessing program, policy and organization effectiveness and efficiency;
- Each agency must designate both a chief evaluation officer and an official with expertise in statistics;
- The OMB must establish an Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to advise on expanding access to government data;
- data must be published in a machine-readable format;
- each agency develop and maintain an inventory of all data assets; and
- a Chief Data Council be established with the Office of Management and Budget for establishing government-wide best practices for data.

### Office of State Budget

The Office of State Budget Director is an agency created by statute.  [KRS 11.068](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).  The Director is appointed by the Governor and serves at the Governor's pleasure.  KRS 11.040.  The state budget director serves on the Governor's executive cabinet. [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  The Cabinet meets on the call of the Governor, but no less than once every two months.  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  The state budget director is one of the Governor's "major assistants" and "shall assist the Governor in the proper operation of the office."  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  Being one of the Cabinet, the Office of State Budget shall "advise and consult with the Governor on all matters affecting the welfare of the State."  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).

The OSB has the following functions, but they are exclusive:

1. Functions relative to the preparation, administration, and evaluation of the executive budget as
provided in KRS Chapters 45 and 48 and in other laws, including but not limited to, capital
construction budgeting, **evaluation of state programs, program monitoring**, financial and policy
analysis and issue review, and **executive policy implementation and compliance**;
2. **Continuous evaluation** of statewide management and administrative procedures and practices,
including but not limited to, organizational analysis and review, economic forecasting, technical
assistance to state agencies, forms control, and special analytic studies as directed by the
Governor; and
3. Staff planning functions of the state planning committee and **evaluation of statewide
management** and administrative practices and procedures.

[KRS 11.068(emphasis added)](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).  The Office of State Budget is further divided into three additional office:  (1) Office of Policy and Management which assists with budgeting, planning and regulation review; (2) Office for Policy Research which assists with policy research data, information and anlysis; and (3) Office for Economic Analysis which carries out revenue estimating, economic analysis and tax administration.  [KRS 11.068](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).
