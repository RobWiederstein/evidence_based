## What is evidence-based policymaking?

According to the [Pew Foundation](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en), "[e]vidence-based policy making uses the best available research and data on program results to inform government budget, policy and management decisions.  It focuses on what works--those programs that rigorous evaluations have shown to achieve positive outcomes." Their 2015 publication, [Legislating Evidence-Based Policymaking:  A look at state laws that support data-driven decision-making](reports/2015-03-01_pew_legislating_evidence_based_policymaking.pdf), showcases many state initiatives and includes Kentucky.

## State Legislative Approaches Categorized

Pew reports that between the years 2004 and 2014, over 100 state statutes passed that promoted the use of evidence-based programs.  They categorized the different legislative approaches across the country and  found that they fell into the following five groups:
1. Require agencies to inventory and categorize funded programs by their evidence of effectiveness.
2. Provide incentives for the use of evidence- and research-based programs.
3.  Restrict funding of programs shown to be ineffective.
4.  Require the use of evidence-or research-based programs.
5.  Dedicate funding to evidence-or research-based programs.

There were several key issues that legislators should consider when drafting statutes.  First, "it is important to provide clear definitions and standards for programs and the evidence needed to meet" the standard.  Second, potential areas for legislation should have a "robust evidence base" like criminal justice and mental health.  And third, even high quality, evidence-based programming can fail if implemented poorly.  Setting performance measures and monitoring compliance with program specifications is crucial for success. However, states have not been the only one active in the area.  The U.S. government also recently passed a major act too.

## U.S. Commission on Evidence-based Policymaking

The U.S. formed a Commission on Evidence-Based Policymaking (CEPM) by [statute](us/2016-03-30_us_evidence_based_comm_act.pdf) to make recommendations on how to improve government effectiveness through the use data and performance measures. The CEPM was established in March of 2017 and released its final report on September 7, 2017.  The 15 member Commission made 22 unanimous recommendations to the President and Congress.

## Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act

The CEPM's work was used in crafting the [Foundations for Evidence-Based Policy Act](us/2019-01-01_foundation_for_evidence_based_policymaking_summary.pdf) which became law in January, 2019.  The Act adopted approximately half of the CEPM's recommendations.

The Act requires that
- agencies annually submit a plan with a list relevant agency-specific policy questions and a list of data to be used as evidence in policymaking.  The Office of Management and Budget is to consolidate the plans into a unified evidence building plan;
- an Interagency Council on Evaluation Policy to assist in assessing program, policy and organization effectiveness and efficiency;
- Each agency must designate both a chief evaluation officer and an official with expertise in statistics;
- The OMB must establish an Advisory Committee on Data for Evidence Building to advise on expanding access to government data;
- data must be published in a machine-readable format;
- each agency develop and maintain an inventory of all data assets; and
- a Chief Data Council be established with the Office of Management and Budget for establishing government-wide best practices for data.

## NASBO

The National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) is comprised of representatives of all fifty states.  NASBO [Budget Processes in the States](reports/2015-03-31_nasbo_budget_processes_in_the_states.pdf) provides comparative analysis in state budgeting practices which was last completed in 2015. The findings are based on the results from a field survey conducted by NASBO in the fall of 2014. The surveys were completed by executive state budget officers in all 50 states.

In table 2, titled "Budget Agency Functions", NASBO lists all the budget offices various functions.  Specifically, agencies were first listed as having "coordination of statewide performance measures".  Thirty-seven (37) state budget offices were assigned that responsibility, but Kentucky was not.  The next category of interest was titled "program evaluation."  Forty-two (42) state budget offices were assigned that responsibility, but Kentucky was not.

NASBO has dedicated a webpage to evidence-based initiatives.  On its [webpage](https://www.nasbo.org/reports-data/using-data-and-evidence), an inventory of states' evidence-based initiatives may be downloaded.  In this inventory ten states (plus DC) reported having at least one initiative that could be characterized as an evidence-based policymaking initiative.

When looking at those primarily located in the budget office, almost all are partnerships with [Results First](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/projects/pew-macarthur-results-first-initiative) (e.g., Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina and Rhode Island). These statesâ€™ budget offices all have staff resources partially or fully dedicated to overseeing Results First projects in their states.  Many other states have partnered with the Pew-MacArthur Results First Initiative, but in those cases, the effort is housed in a single agency - like a Department of Corrections, the legislature, or another entity.  In addition to the above, NASBO also has an extremely useful [resources guide](reports/2018-10-01_nasbo_resource_guide.pdf).

### Office of State Budget

The Office of State Budget Director is an agency created by statute.  [KRS 11.068](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).  The Director is appointed by the Governor and serves at the Governor's pleasure.  KRS 11.040.  The state budget director serves on the Governor's executive cabinet. [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  The Cabinet meets on the call of the Governor, but no less than once every two months.  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  The state budget director is one of the Governor's "major assistants" and "shall assist the Governor in the proper operation of the office."  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).  Being a member of the Cabinet, the Office of State Budget shall "advise and consult with the Governor on all matters affecting the welfare of the State."  [KRS 11.065](statutes/KRS_11.065.pdf).

The OSB has the following functions, but they are exclusive:

1. Functions relative to the preparation, administration, and evaluation of the executive budget as
provided in KRS Chapters 45 and 48 and in other laws, including but not limited to, capital
construction budgeting, **evaluation of state programs, program monitoring**, financial and policy
analysis and issue review, and **executive policy implementation and compliance**;
2. **Continuous evaluation** of statewide management and administrative procedures and practices,
including but not limited to, organizational analysis and review, economic forecasting, technical
assistance to state agencies, forms control, and special analytic studies as directed by the
Governor; and
3. Staff planning functions of the state planning committee and **evaluation of statewide
management** and administrative practices and procedures.

[KRS 11.068(emphasis added)](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).  The Office of State Budget is further divided into three additional office:  (1) Office of Policy and Management which assists with budgeting, planning and regulation review; (2) Office for Policy Research which assists with policy research data, information and anlysis; and (3) Office for Economic Analysis which carries out revenue estimating, economic analysis and tax administration.  [KRS 11.068](statutes/KRS_11.068.pdf).

### Department of Corrections Evidence-based initiative

In 2010, the Kentucky legislature established the bipartisan, inter-branch task force on
the Penal Code and Controlled Substances Act.  Due to the growing prisoner population, Kentucky enacted criminal justice reform in 2012 known as "HB 463".  Its enactment was controversial at the time.  As a part of the reforms, the bill required programs funded by the Department of Corrections to use "evidence-based" practices.  The act was codified at KRS 196.111.  "Evidence-based" was defined as a practice that "scientific research demonstrates [to] reduce recidivism among inmates and individuals . . . when implemented competently."  [KRS 196.111(1)](statutes/KRS_196.111.pdf).  Monies were to be shifted away from programming that did not reduce recidivism toward programming that would. The DOC annual report on the HB 463 forms can be found [here](statutes/KRS_196.111.pdf).

A recent evaluation was completed of Kentucky's substance abuse programs. The summary of the report stated:

>The Criminal Justice Kentucky Treatment Outcome Study (CJKTOS) examined substance abuse outcomes of state offenders participating in substance abuse treatment programs in Kentuckyâ€™s prisons, jails, and community custody settings. This report includes data collected during FY2018 for 344 randomly selected participants who entered Department of Corrections (DOC) substance abuse treatment programs (SAP), participated in an intake assessment by treatment counselors, and were followed-up 12-months later in the community following their treatment completion and release from custody. This report includes data collected during FY2018 from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.

The reported outcomes were:
- 56.7% had not been re-incarcerated.
- 86.0% were living in stable housing.
- 62.5% were employed.
- 77.9% reported providing financial support to their children.
- 48.0% did not use any illicit substances in the year since release.
- 71.5% attended 12-Step meetings.

Additionally, the cost-benefit was for every $1 in cost there were $3.90 in benefits.
